tely optimized in a discrete way. Theoretical analysis shows that the learning (optimization) algorithm of COSDISH has a constant-approximation bound in each step of the alternating optimization procedure. Empirical results on datasets with semantic labels illustrate that COSDISH can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in real applications like image retrieval.~
