### Learning-to-Hash Survey Paper

The full survey is available [as a research paper](http://seanjmoran.com/pdfs/hashing_review.pdf) currently under submission to a peer-reviewed journal. Full citation information will appear here in due course. In the meantime please cite the following thesis upon which the review is based:

<pre>

  author       = {Sean Moran}, 
  title        = {Learning to hash for large-scale image retrieval},
  school       = {University of Edinburgh},
  year         = 2016,
}
</pre>

### Presentations and Relevant Introductory Material

Please also see the excellent [tutorial slides](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/slides/L2H.pdf) of [Dr. Wu-Jun Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/) for a nice introduction to the field.

[Dr Victor Lavrenko](https://www.youtube.com/user/victorlavrenko) has two excellent youtube videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arni-zkqMBA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgH0NP8Qxa8), describing the basics of locality sensitive hashing (LSH). These are ideal for those just entering the field or curious how to apply the method to their problem domain.

There are also alternative survey papers which are complementary to this one and take a different approach to summarising available research. The reader is encouraged to further explore the following publications:

* [Learning to Hash for Indexing Big Data - A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.05472.pdf)
* [A Survey on Learning to Hash](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00185.pdf)
* [Learning Binary Hash Codes for Large-Scale Image Search](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/temp/GraumanFergus_Hashing_chapterdraft.pdf)

### Courses
A few university courses are been taught covering aspects of machine learning for code, big code or naturalnness of efficient computing. Below there are a few that have publicly available material.
* [Extreme Computing](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/exc/index_17-18.html) in University of Edinburgh.

### Blog Posts
Blog posts provide a great way to learn about cutting edge research and ideas. Here are a few of our favourites:
